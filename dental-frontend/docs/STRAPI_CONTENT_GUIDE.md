## SEO Best Practices

### Why SEO Matters

Good SEO helps your pages:

- Naturally, don't force it

**Example:**
If targeting "dental implants Boston":
- Title: "Dental Implants Boston"

- Services: Include "dental implants" in descriptions

### URL Structure (Slug)

❌ **Bad:**
- `/page1`
- `/new-page-copy-2`

**Tips:**
- Use hyphens, not underscores
- Keep it short (3-5 words max)
- Include main keyword
- Use lowercase only
- Avoid special characters
